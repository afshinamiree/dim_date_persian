# dim_date_persian
there is always a problem when you are creating dim_date for persian dates as you have to deal with leap years, day of year  and also week number of the year.
I have created a dim_date_persian file along with sql_server code. If you do not use sql -server there still is the option of downloading the csv file.
as there is some differences among sql databases. please do share your comment with me.
